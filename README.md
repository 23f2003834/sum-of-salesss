# Sales Summary Single-Page Application

This is a simple client-side web application that fetches sales data from an attached CSV file, calculates the total sales, and displays the result dynamically. It demonstrates the integration of Bootstrap 5.3.3 for styling, includes a fallback style, and performs several validation checks.

## Features

- Fetches embedded CSV data simulating an attachment.
- Parses CSV and sums the 'sales' column.
- Sets the document title with a base64-decoded seed string.
- Displays the total sales inside a styled Bootstrap alert.
- Ensures Bootstrap CSS is loaded.
- Performs validation on document title, CSS loading, and total calculation.

## Usage

Open the `index.html` file in a browser. The app runs entirely on the client-side with JavaScript.

## Notes

- In this example, the CSV data is embedded within the script to simulate an attachment. In a real scenario, replace the fetch source accordingly.
- Validation logs are printed to console for verification.
